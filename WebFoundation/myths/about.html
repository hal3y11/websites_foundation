    <h2>About us</h2>
    <p>Musical Youth Theatre Stoke aims to develop the singing, acting and dancing skills of children and young people from Stoke and surrounding areas.</p>
    <p>Through the integration of creative workshops and skills based training, MYTS works towards an annual fully-staged musical production or showcase. All workshop and production staff are theatre professionals or experienced musicians and performers.</p>
    <p>MYTS also encourages the parents and families of the children to become involved in local theatre, in the many roles requiring volunteers to enable quality and successful shows to be performed.</p>
    <p>Musical Youth Theatre Stoke is the junior arm of Stoke and District Operatic Society. It began in March 2007 and has enjoyed several major successful productions, staged at the <a href="https://www.newvictheatre.org.uk/">New Vic Theatre</a>, Stoke. Members from MYTS have also performed alongside SDOS in concert as well as at other events in Staffordshire.</p>
