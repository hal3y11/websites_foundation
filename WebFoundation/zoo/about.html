                        <li>Haleys Zoo has decades of experience working with exotic animals, which means every aspect
                            of your animal encounter is first class.</li>

                        <li> Haleys Zoo are licenced to operate as a Zoo. This means they are inspected to the same
                            standards as all UK Zoo's. This includes such large zoo's as Chester Zoo!</li>

                        <li> There are many animal encounter companies throughout the UK. Some claim to offer a lot for
                            a little price, however there are some important questions that you should be asking when
                            deciding who to use.</li>

                    <ol>
                        <li> Volunteers play a very important role within Haleys Zoo as they assist our staff and
                            provide excellent customer service, which in turn helps with the success of the business.
                        </li>

                        <li>Haleys Zoo welcomes volunteers to assist in our daily care and upkeep of our animals. We can
                            also offer voluntary positions in marketing and business studies. We are a small family run
                            business so you may find that you are asked to carry out duties that appear unrelated to the
                            voluntary position.</li>

                        <li>Volunteer support is vital as it allows us to carry out additional, but important tasks such
                            as behavioural observations or creating new enrichment ideas.</li>
