            <p>With the new season fast approaching, our teams have been getting back into action with their pre-season
                training.
                For the past few weeks, they have been training at Stone Hockey Club on Thursday
                evenings, whilst they have also played an inter-squad friendly to increase match sharpness</p>

            <h2>Changes to Men's fixtures</h2>
            <img src="Images/mens1.jpg" alt="News logo" width="300" height="200">
            <p>Following the withdrawal of some lower Nottingham based teams to form their own development
                league, there have been some fixture changes within our league. This includes the opening round of
                fixtures, which are still scheduled for Saturday 1st October</p>
            <p>The Men's team will now face Bloxwich on the opening day rather than Wednesbury, who they instead travel
                to the
                following week.</p>

            <img src="Images/junior1.jpg" alt="News logo" width="300" height="200">
            <p>Our elite junior team will enter England Hockey indoor and outdoor competitions, giving them the
                opportunity to play at the highest level. The past couple of years have been a learning curve at such
                a high standard, but also excellent for player development with competitive Sunday fixtures
                supplementing junior hockey on Saturdays.</p>
